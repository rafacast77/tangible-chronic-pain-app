# Tangible Chronic Pain App   :tangerine: 
The investigation of the master project researches chronic pain and how a computer-based pain diary can help sufferers manage their pain. During the research, paper-based and existing computer-based solutions were analysed, and several gaps were detected and included in the project specification to create a novel solution that fills those gaps.
 
The master project contains the software specifications and documentation of the project software development life cycle featuring project management methodologies, design, architecture, development, evaluation, deployment and conclusions.
